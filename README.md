Credit Risk Analysis 📊

This project focuses on Credit Risk Prediction using Machine Learning techniques.
The objective is to evaluate loan applicants and classify them into low-risk or high-risk categories, helping financial institutions reduce defaults and optimize decision-making.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze customer data for loan approval risk.

Build and evaluate machine learning models for credit risk classification.

Provide insights into important features that influence risk assessment.

Support decision-making in the Banking & Financial Services Industry (BFSI).

📂 Project Workflow

Data Collection & Preprocessing

Handle missing values and categorical encoding.

Normalize/standardize numeric features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize class distributions.

Correlation analysis between variables.

Model Development

Train ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).

Hyperparameter tuning for performance improvement.

Model Evaluation

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.

Compare models and select the best-performing one.

Results & Insights

Identify key drivers of credit risk.

Provide recommendations for lenders.
